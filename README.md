# Map Tile Downloader

The Map Tile Downloader is a Flask-based web application designed to download map tiles from various sources. It allows users to select specific areas on a map, choose zoom levels, and download tiles for offline use. The application supports converting tiles to 8-bit color depth for compatibility with Meshtastic® UI Maps and provides options to view and manage cached tiles.

- **World Basemap Downloads**: Download tiles for the entire world at zoom levels 0-7.
- **8-bit Conversion**: Option to convert downloaded tiles to 8-bit color depth for Meshtastic® UI Maps.
- **Cache Management**: View and delete cached tiles for different map styles.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar showing downloaded, skipped, and failed tiles.
- **Configurable Map Sources**: Easily add or modify map sources via a JSON configuration file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher (For Windows, make sure that Python in installed with the ADD TO PATH option selected)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository (or download the zip file and extract to the location of your choice):
   
		git clone https://github.com/mattdrum/map-tile-downloader.git
		cd map-tile-downloader
   
2. Install Dependencies (Optional) :
    	The application will automatically install required dependencies from requirements.txt on startup. However, you can manually install them using:

		pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Configuration (Optional, default sources are included) :

   Ensure the config/map_sources.json file is present and correctly formatted. See the Configuration section below for an example.
   
   
## Configuration
The application uses a JSON configuration file (config/map_sources.json) to define available map sources. Each entry consists of a name and a URL template for the tiles.

Example map_sources.json:
	
		"OpenStreetMap": "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"OpenTopoMap": "https://{s}.tile.opentopomap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"Stamen Terrain": "http://{s}.tile.stamen.com/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"CartoDB Positron": "https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
		"CartoDB Dark Matter": "https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
	

Adding a New Map Source: Simply add a new key-value pair to the JSON file with the map name and its tile URL template.


## Usage
